## What's the idea?

The original concept was for a speed-based cooking game, where ingredients are prepared, and prepared ingredients are used to form meals for NPCs. The mechanisms allow for a player to collect various cooking tools that interact
with ingredients to create meals. Different tool levels affect how fast you can prepare ingredients and user level affects meal possibilities. Tool actions are restricted to subsets of ingredients (meat can be sliced or chopped, dough can be rolled, etc.), so switching between tools efficiently also becomes a game mechanic.
