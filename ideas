Ideas


Player starts at level 1
Player must choose a baron/baroness to cook for
Player is given a weekly stipend based on how much the baron trusts them (plus player reputation)
Barons can have food allergies, various preferences that yield better results (more trust)
Players can use their stipend to buy ingredients and explore various recipes
Based on baron preferences, the player will present meals and attempt to get their stipend increased
Eventually a baron may hit their stipend limit, in which case the player can quit and go to work for a wealthier baron
Eventually a player may be able (based on reputation) to become a chef for royalty 

Other mechanics include:
Players being able to hire sous chefs for automating various cooking tasks
Players can buy tools to increase efficiency of various cooking tasks

maybe the highest level you can cook for is the queen/king (or god?)? (see line 11)

** You can quit your job at any point to work for another baron. However the baron you leave will immediately have negative trust, and trust will slowly return to 0 over time.
** You can intentionally feed barons recipes that include 3 of their allergies in order to kill them. This mode of play we shall call Lenin Mode.
** Throughout the course of the game, you may hear about a Baron having favorite recipes. The user will be greatly rewarded if they can craft one.

** Turn based -- User constructs a menu per day. A day is a turn -- which updates expirations of any ingredients in User's inventory, among other things
-- maybe a turn should be a meal, and then after three turns (or however many) is when the day resets
-- that way the user could, say, visit the market to try something different for dinner

Menu - courses // Meal types
What is the current meal?
What are courses? Can you just have one course? 

Barons have some kind of complexity preference on class composition

CLASSES
--milk
--water
--bread 
--fruit
--vegetables
--proteins 
--starch

(protein, vegetable, grain)


(protein, starch)
  -Steak and Fries
    //Steak is a subclass of protein and fries are a subclass of starch
    
Re


****
User can only mix a certain amount of ingredients in a course based on level
LEVEL 1 - 3 
LEVEL 5 - 4
LEVEL 10  - 5
etc.

CAN APPLY SPICES TO INGREDIENTS -- each subclass has a defined amount of SPICE SLOTS

Tool quality decay is a function of tool RATING -- is this tool level? what is this?
